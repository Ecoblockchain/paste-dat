# PasteDat

PasteDat is a peer-to-peer gist-like tool. It uses the [Beaker browser's](https://beakerbrowser.com) [APIs](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/) to write files with the [Dat protocol](https://github.com/datproject/dat).

All file snippets created with PasteDat are hosted directly from your device and on a peer-to-peer network, and only people who know the secret URL will be able to discover and download the files. [Learn more](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tutorials/share-files-secretly.html).
